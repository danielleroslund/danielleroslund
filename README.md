## Hi, I'm Danielle

<!--
**danielleroslund/danielleroslund** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I've been enjoying web development ever since I started building my **Full-stack Library Application**. Working with **React** and **Spring Boot** has been an exciting journey, sparking my curiosity to dive deeper into full-stack development.

For the past two years, Iâ€™ve primarily worked with **Java** and have recently started learning **Python** to expand my skill set. Iâ€™m now seeking a role in **backend** or **frontend** development where I can continue to grow and contribute to meaningful projects.

If youâ€™re hiring, **letâ€™s chat!** ðŸš€
