## Hi, I'm Danielle Roslund

<!--
**danielleroslund/danielleroslund** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I've been enjoying web development ever since I started building my **Full-stack Library Application**. Working with **React** and **Spring Boot** has been an exciting journey, sparking my curiosity to dive deeper into full-stack development.

For the past two years, I’ve primarily worked with **Java** and have recently started learning **Python** to expand my skill set. I’m now seeking a role in **backend** or **frontend** development where I can continue to grow and contribute to meaningful projects.

If you’re hiring, **let’s chat!** 🚀
