## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**danielleroslund/danielleroslund** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->
I'm a passionate software developer with hands-on experience in full-stack web development, especially with **React** and **Spring Boot**. Building my Full-stack Library Application sparked my curiosity to dive deeper into both frontend and backend technologies.

For the past two years, I've focused on **Java** and recently expanded into **Python** and AI to broaden my skill set. I'm now seeking opportunities in backend or frontend development where I can grow and make an impact.

If youâ€™re hiring, letâ€™s chat! ðŸš€
